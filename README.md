# TakeMeThere

Simple application built with spring framework to find shortest path between two locations. It uses client server model which interacts via RESTful APIs. Client can select the locations on map or through drop down and server will give the route using algorithms like Dijkstra's, Bellman Ford and A* algorithm. API's are created for basic CRUD operations on location, which stores data in mondodb using ORM.
